/*
Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:
*/
function sequentialSizes(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line

  switch(val){
    case 1 :
    case 2 :
    case 3 :
     answer = "Low";
     break;
    case 4 :
    case 5 :
    case 6 :
     answer = "Mid";
     break;
    case 7 :
    case 8 :
    case 9 :
    answer = "High";
  }

  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
