/*Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word Charles is C. So if const firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

// Setup
let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
 firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // Change this line
